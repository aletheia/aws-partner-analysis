These challenges include delivering proven and cost-effective solutions to customers, improving control of operational risks, better customer engagement, and the ability to better compete in a regulated market. An efficient utility billing system allows providers to track and monitor the utility services they offer, manage billing processes, collect data, and engage well with customers. Building, maintaining, and supporting such a solution is often cost-prohibitive for small and medium sized utilities. Traditional packaged solutions are often complex, require heavy customization, and are often priced outside the organization’s budget. Recognizing these challenges as an opportunity to assist customers to digitally transform their operations while reducing overall cost of ownership, AWS and Accenture collaborated to build a vertical solution called Uptility, for utilities in regulated markets.

With AWS Fargate there is no need to worry about managing servers, dealing with capacity planning or finding a way to isolate containers for workflow security. Amazon ECS allows you to define application requirements, either from the console or the command line, and will manage the infrastructure needed to run the containers. Amazon ECS Anywhere allows you to use the Amazon ECS console and the usual operational tools to manage your On-Premise container workflows for a consistent experience across all container-based applications. AWS Systems Manager (SSM) integration establishes reliability automatically and securely between on-premises hardware and the AWS control plane. Amazon ECS provides high security and design isolation; in fact, it natively integrates with the security, identity, management, and governance tools you already rely on, which allows you to get to production easily and successfully.","offering_status":"Active","refiners":["Product : Compute : Amazon ECS","Product : Compute"],"availability":"General Availability","delivery_model":"Other","title":"ZERO12 ECS Service Delivery","solution_id":"a2q8W000006K6dzQAC","record_type":"Consulting Service","solution_url_dup":"https://www.zero12.it/pack/amazonecs/","validation_level_detailed":"Advanced","solution_name":["Amazon ECS Delivery"],"offering_type":"Consulting Service","proposition":"ZERO12 ECS Service Delivery","created_date":"2023-03-10 05:06:57","solution_url":"null|null|null|null|null|https://www.zero12.it/pack/amazonecs/","validation_level":"Advanced"}],"competency":["Migration Consulting Competency","SaaS Consulting Competency","Storage Consulting Competency"],"public_sector":{"categories":1,"program_categories":["Government"],"contract":0},"programs":["Authorized Training Partner","AWS Solution Provider Program","AWS Public Sector Solution Provider","APN Immersion Days"],"offices":[{"country":"Italy","latlon":{"lon":11.737869580569487,"lat":45.65837642413871},"city":"Empoli","street":"VAR Group S.p.A.

Die Integrationsservices von MARZIPAN Web bieten hierfür zahlreiche Kommunikationsschnittstellen und -dienste. Darüber hinaus bieten sie die Möglichkeit, beispielsweise aus dem Kreditberatungssystem der Bank die kalkulationsrelevanten Nominaldaten sowie die technischen Anmeldedaten des Anwenders über eine Schnittstelle an MARZIPAN zu übergeben und direkt in die jeweilige vorausgefüllte Kalkulationsmaske von MARZIPAN zu springen. Hier können die für die Kalkulation übergebenen Daten um beispielsweise Zinsstrukturen oder Deckungsbeitragsschemata ergänzt und dann die Kalkulation durchgeführt werden. Nach Abschluss der Berechnung werden die Ergebnisdaten aus MARZIPAN an das aufrufende System übergeben, und es erfolgt der „Rücksprung“ in diese Anwendung. Darüber hinaus bieten die Integrationsservices von MARZIPAN Web weitere interessante Möglichkeiten, wie zum Beispiel: • Manueller Import und Export von Geschäften in MARZIPAN Web (durch den Anwender gesteuert) • Automatischer Import und Export von Geschäften, automatische Kalkulation und, je nach Anforderung, automatisches Melden des Geschäfts (Statuskonzept) MARZIPAN Kalkulationsservice Hier wird die finanzmathematische Rechenlogik in Form eines Use-Case-basierten Kalkulationsservices zur Verfügung gestellt. So kann modernes, bankfachliches Know-how direkt in bestehende Bankprozesse integriert werden. Die Integration über den Kalkulationsservice ist für all jene Anwender interessant, die die finanzmathematischen Funktionen des MARZIPAN-Rechenkerns in vorhandenen IT-Anwendungen einsetzen oder deren Einsatz planen. Hier bietet der Kalkulationsservice als Verbindung zwischen Bankanwendung und Rechenkern einen hohen Mehrwert. Der Kalkulationsservice bietet unter anderem folgende Vorteile und zeigt diese Merkmale: • Mit dem Kalkulationsservice werden die finanzmathematischen Funktionen des MARZIPAN Rechenkerns direkt in die bestehenden IT-Systeme eingebunden. Systemund/oder Medienbrüche werden vermieden. • Zur Ansteuerung des Kalkulationsservices ist kein Experten-Know-how zum Rechenkern notwendig. • Die Validierung der Daten und die Ansteuerung des Rechenkerns (zum Beispiel Mehrfachaufruf bei Berechnung des Vorfälligkeitsentgelts) sind vollständig im Kalkulationsservice integriert. • Die Übergabe der Daten erfolgt geschäftsvorfallbezogen. • Der Kalkulationsservice wird über HTTP/HTTPS netzwerkweit erreicht. • MARZIPAN kann im Hintergrund ohne Oberfläche arbeiten, wodurch der Bediener (optisch) sein gewohntes Kernbankensystem nicht verlässt.","offering_status":"Active","availability":"General Availability","delivery_model":"Software as a Service (SaaS)","title":"MARZIPAN on AWS (Banking)","solution_id":"a2q8a000002QmGiAAK","record_type":"Technology Product","solution_url_dup":"https://marzipan.msgforbanking.de/","validation_level_detailed":"Foundational","offering_type":"Software Product","foundational_technical_review":"Approved","proposition":"Umfassendes Leistungsspektrum für Ihre individuellen Anforderungen Mit den verschiedenen Produktlinien von MARZIPAN steht Ihnen ein Beratungswerkzeug zur Verfügung, das eine schnelle, transparente und sichere Einzel- und Massengeschäftskalkulation ermöglicht.

MARZIPAN – zukunftsfähige Technologie Die digitale Transformation zeigt sich verstärkt in neuen und weiterentwickelten Systeminfrastrukturen und Datenbanksystemen. ERP-Systeme werden überarbeitet und neu modelliert. MARZIPAN Kunden legen, unabhängig von fachlichen Nutzungsmöglichkeiten, ihr technisches Augenmerk vermehrt auf Integration und Zusammenspiel von Drittanwendungen und Kernbankensystem. Um digitale Lösungen verschiedener Anbieter unkompliziert und standardisiert integrieren zu können, legen Finanzunternehmen Wert darauf, ihre Systemlandschaft offen zu gestalten. Entsprechend hoch ist ihr Anspruch an aktuelle Technologien und Services. Damit öffnet sich zunehmend der Weg hin zu Plattformen und Ökosystemen. Der Betrieb von Systemen ist im Wandel: weg von eigenen Servern, hin zu Cloud-Lösungen mit Unterstützung von Managed Services. MARZIPAN ist, dank der breiten Nutzung in unterschiedlichsten Säulen der Finanzwirtschaft, an eine Vielzahl von Kernbankensystemen angebunden und integriert. Dies ermöglicht ein effizienter Softwareaufbau, intelligente Schnittstellen und eine kontinuierliche technische Weiterentwicklung. Dabei kann MARZIPAN als Standardsoftware in nahezu beliebige Systemumgebungen eingefügt und so zum Beispiel effizient in Vertriebsprozesse integriert werden. Das gilt insbesondere für die zunehmend aufkommenden Plattformen und Ökosysteme. Mit der MARZIPAN Salesforce-App besteht darüber hinaus ein spezifisches Integrationsmodell der finanzmathematischen Berechnungsfunktionen im Ökosystem des Salesforce-CRM-Systems. msg GillardonBSM bietet MARZIPAN als Managed Services über SaaS (Software as a Service) an. Daraus entstehen Vorteile, wie zum Beispiel: • Kosteneffizienz durch Cloud-Angebote und Lizenzierung von anwenderspezifischen Use Cases • Individuelle Skalierbarkeit und Hochverfügbarkeit der Anwendung sowie der Berechnungsfunktionen • Flexibilität bei der Digitalisierung der eigenen Anwendungslandschaft durch Lösungen und Anbindungsstrategien, die von Drittanbietern in der Cloud zur Verfügung gestellt werden","created_date":"2022-05-02 09:01:37","solution_url":"null|null|null|null|null|https://marzipan.msgforbanking.de/","validation_level":"Foundational"}],"competency":["SAP Consulting Competency"],"public_sector":{"categories":3,"program_categories":["Government","Education","Nonprofit"],"contract":0},"programs":["Authorized Training Partner","AWS Public Sector Partner","AWS Solution Provider Program"],"offices":[{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Berlin","street":"Wittestraße 30, Gebäude K, 6.OG","postalcode":"13509","state":"Berlin"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Hamburg","street":"Bei dem Neuen Krahn 2","postalcode":"20457","state":"Hamburg"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Hannover","street":"Hildesheimer Straße 265","postalcode":"30519","state":"Niedersachsen"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Lingen","street":"Kaiserstraße 10b","postalcode":"49809","state":"Niedersachsen"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Nürnberg","street":"Südwestpark 60","postalcode":"90449","state":"Bayern"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Passau","street":"Dr.-​Hans-Kapfinger-Straße 30","postalcode":"94032","state":"Bayern"},{"country":"Germany","latlon":{"lon":11.686604229444395,"lat":48.22872023252463},"city":"Ismaning","street":"Robert-Bürkle-Str. 1","postalcode":"85737","state":"Bayern","location_type":["Headquarters"]},{"country":"Brazil","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"São Paulo","street":"Rua Tijuco Preto, 393 - sala 172","postalcode":"CEP: 03316-​000","state":"SP"},{"country":"China","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Shanghai","street":"Room 1603, Pinzun Executive Mansion, 597 Langao Road","postalcode":"200333","state":"Putuo District"},{"country":"Great Britain","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"London","street":"16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden","postalcode":"WC2B 5AH","state":"London"},{"country":"India","latlon":{"lon":0,"lat":0},"city":"Bangalore","street":"Block 11, 2nd Floor, Wing-B Primal Projects Pvt Ltd.
